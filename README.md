# MyDailyGist Newsletter

## Introduction
### *What this project is all about:*
I started this project because I struggle to find news that I care about, there are so many websites posting so many articles and I get paralyzed by all the options. I also found that most newsletters are cookie cutter and lack the capability to customize news based on the specific interests of each reader. This is why the overarching goal of this project is to create a highly customizable, news aggregating email that shows the reader the most important news from topics they find interesting.
### *What this project is:*
This project is an AWS cloud based email newsletter for customized news/article summaries sent to your email every morning. The newsletter scrapes RSS feeds of several reputable news websites and formats the info into a easy to read format. Subscribers are allowed to pick between an email that summarizes the latest political, financial and/or technological news. These emails are automatically sent out to subscribers at 5 AM EST every morning. 

## Next steps (no particular order):
1. Build out a website so users can sign themselves up.
2. Develop a recommendation algorithm that selects articles of interest to send users/organizes emails so that most interesting article is at the top.
3. Set up an UAT lane to conduct testing of new features with a smaller user group.
4. More enhancements in the customizability of the emails users get.
