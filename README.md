# MyDailyGist Newsletter

## Introduction
I started this project because I struggle to find news that I care about, there are so many websites posting so many articles and I get paralyzed by all the options. Rather than spend 45 minutes a day searching through websites to find interesting articles I had mostly stopped searching all together. I developed this project so that I didn't have to parse through dozens of websites every day to find what interests me most. This project is an AWS cloud based email newsletter for customized news/article summaries sent to your email every morning. The newsletter scrapes RSS feeds of several reputable news websites and formats the info into a easy to read format. Subscribers are allowed to pick between an email that summarizes the latest political, financial and/or technological news. These emails are automatically sent out to subscribers at 5 AM EST every morning. The general thesis of this project is customizability, through the website I'm building out, I want users to have maximum control over the content that they are recieving. 

## Next steps (no particular order):
1. Build out a website so users can sign themselves up.
2. Develop a recommendation algorithm that selects articles of interest to send users/organizes emails so that most interesting article is at the top.
3. Set up an UAT lane to conduct testing of new features with a smaller user group.
4. More enhancements in the customizability of the emails users get.
